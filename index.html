            <p>On this page I will be introducing some of the things I will be talking about as well as what will be on
              the other headings.</p>
            <p>Here I will be talking about the things that I did this summer and a lot of them were new to me. I didn't go into summer 2021 with a bucket list, these events just seemed to fall into my lap. My favourite two food places I found out about are Seoul Dogs and La Cigale.</p>
            <p>Here's the food:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a href="https://seouldogott.square.site/" target="_blank">Seoul Dogs</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.lacigaleicecream.com/index.html" target="_blank">La Cigale</a>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="food">The Food</h2>
            <p>As previously stated, I visited Seoul Dogs this summer. The first time I tried it, I was very scared because I can't eat new foods, but it now has ended up being my favourite food of all time. Seoul Dogs sells Korean dogs which is almost like the American corn dog but is battered with panko instead of cornmeal. You're then able to put either, hot dog, cheese, or a mix of both inside of it.</p>
            <p>Then there are toppings on top. You can customize with hashbrowns, ramen crisps, sugar, garlic sugar and then dipping sauces. These are popular street foods in South Korea, where kids after school would pick one up and eat it on the way home. At this location they make them three times as big as the ones in Korea. A normal person would eat one every two-three weeks. 
              I go three-four times a week. The owner has since recognized and has hooked me up with discounts and free food. I highly recommend trying this place out. </p>
              <p>The next place I tried twice this summer and that is La Cigale. The ice cream and milkshakes are so creamy. They are made in house and in small batches so the quality is up to par. I went for the first time after a four hour hike in Gatineau Park and got a passionfruit ice cream for myself and a vanilla scoop in a cup for my dog. I can't wait for next summer to go back to this one.</p>

              <h2 class="events">The Events</h2>
              Some of the events that took place during these four months were:
              <ul>
                <li>Going to my sister's high school graduation</li>
                <li>Adopting a dog</li>
                <li>Getting a thigh tattoo</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="grad">High School Grad</h3>
              <p>Not an interesting event to you, but I was so excited when my sister graduated high school. I felt sorry of the fact that she wasn't able to walk across stage or even have a prom. The good news was that they allowed the students to come by and get pictures taken in a cap and gown.</p>
              <h3 class="puppy">Puppy</h3>
              <p>The opportunity presented itself when it appeared on my Facebook. I saw that this puppy was currently being fostered and was going to be put up for adoption. She was so cute and looked like the dog I have now. Very unique markings I find anyways. It felt like kismet so we drove down to Toronto and back in the same day to get her. She was being put up by the Toronto Animal Services and came from a bad situation. It took about a week until we found a name that fits (Luna) and it has been three months since we've had her.</p>
              <h3 class="tattoo">Tattoo</h3>
              <p>It was a birthday gift this summer and me and my sister and my friend went over to Montreal to visit an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chibitattoomtl/?hl=en" target="_blank" >anime themed tattoo shop.</a> The artist was amazing and did the work so clean and crisp. The tattoo is Jotaro from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. You can see how much I love the show since I made a whole website about it last time.</p>
